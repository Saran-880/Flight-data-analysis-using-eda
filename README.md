# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, patterns, and key insights from the dataset. The analysis helps identify trends, relationships between variables, missing values, and potential anomalies before applying any modeling techniques.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the overall structure of the dataset
- Identify missing values and data quality issues
- Analyze distributions of numerical and categorical variables
- Discover relationships and patterns between features
- Generate meaningful insights using visualizations

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and initial inspection
- Handling missing values
- Data type corrections and formatting
- Univariate analysis
- Bivariate and multivariate analysis
- Visual exploration using plots and charts
- Insight generation based on observed patterns

## Project Output
  This file contains the complete EDA report with code, outputs, and visualizations. It can be opened directly in any web browser.

---

## How to View the Project
1. Download the repository
2. Open the `eda project final.html` file in a browser
3. Scroll through the analysis and visualizations

---

## Insights Gained
- Clear understanding of data distribution and variability
- Identification of important features affecting outcomes
- Detection of missing values and outliers
- Improved data readiness for further analysis or modeling

---

## Conclusion
This EDA project provides a strong foundation for further data analysis and machine learning tasks. By understanding the data thoroughly, better decisions can be made in feature selection and model building.
